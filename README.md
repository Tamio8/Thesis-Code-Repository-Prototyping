# Thesis-Code-Repository-Prototyping

This repository contains the code used for generating clinical decision support prototypes as part of the PhD project *"Bridging Human Needs and Machine Potential in Intensive Care:
Conceptual Considerations for a Care-Full Design at the Intersection of Context, Code and Complexity"* by Tamara Orth (Queensland University of Technology, 2025).

The code includes data filtering and simulated interface logic for three main prototypes:

- **Dynamic Summary**
    
- **Fluid Balance Tracker**
    
- **Similarity-Based Patient Explorer**
    

Each folder contains code related to a specific prototype, including mock interfaces and data processing. The `data-access-big-query/` folder contains supporting scripts for filtering ICU cohorts and exploring the structure of the MIMIC data.  The `prototype-code/` folder contains the code for the prototype visualisation.

For further details on the development, design rationale, or intended use of the prototypes, please refer to the full thesis.

### Data Source

All prototypes were developed in Python using Google Colab and Dash, and utilize data extracted from the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III databases via Google BigQuery. Access to MIMIC was approved via the PhysioNet credentialing process and conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines.

### Dependencies
Key libraries:

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `dash`, `dash-bootstrap-components`
    
- Data accessed via `google.cloud.bigquery` in Google Colab

### Notes

- This repository is designed for illustrative purposes only. Code was simplified for prototyping and demonstration and is not production-ready.
    
- Filtering choices (e.g., adult, septic, first ICU stay, non-immunocompromised) were made to **reduce data volume and simplify processing**, not for clinical significance.
    
- Code includes simulated interface logic and illustrative data to support clinician feedback collection.
